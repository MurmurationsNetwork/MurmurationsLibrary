The object_url should be the Primary URL of the receiving entity (e.g., https://alice.org), and the predicate should describe the relationship the subject has with that entity (e.g. 'trust Alice to hold a copy of my house keys'). An optional description field can describe the relationship in a complete sentence (e.g., 'I (Bob) trust Alice to hold a copy of my house keys.')."
